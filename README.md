Hi! I'm Sehbazz, and this is the SMA Proposal Wizard (otherwise known as the SMA Resume Wizard, The Wizard, or lovingly called "The Wiz").

The SMA Proposal Wizard was a project I undertook while I worked at SMA consulting, a Construction Project Management firm in Edmonton, AB.

It's purpose is to store snippets of resume text for every employee at SMA and every project ever completed by SMA. SMA is very interested in building high quality, custom resumes quickly since resumes need to get submitted in any job proposal. The Wizard helped writers to quickly build custom resumes by selecting biographies, experiences, descriptions, and various other settings. As I developed it it went on to allow users to write new sections, work on multiple resumes at a time, and generally speed up the resume writing process. The Wizard became a powerful tool to give SMA an edge over other firms during the proposal writing process.

The Wizard is still used at SMA, where it stores and manipulates data for 100+ biographies, 200+ projects, and 1000+ descriptions of experience. SMA has kindly let me display The Wizard online, and I have added some (frivolous) sample projects and employees to demonstrate it's workings. Note that the Wizard at SMA was hosted in a way to allow users to make changes to the underlying data. This deployment is configured so that any changes only appear on your browser.

Please email me with any questions, suggestions, or general discussions you have!
