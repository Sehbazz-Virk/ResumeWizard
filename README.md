Source files for the SMA Resume Wizard

The SMA Resume Wizard was a project I undertook while I worked at SMA consulting, a Construction Project Management firm in Edmonton, AB.

It's purpose is to store snippets of resume text for every employee at SMA and every project ever completed by SMA. SMA is very interested in building high quality,
custom resumes quickly since resumes need to get submitted in any job proposal. The Wizard then allowed writers to quickly build custom resumes by selecting biographies, 
experiences, descriptions, and various other settings. As I developed it it went on to allow users to write new sections, work on multiple resumes at a time,
and generally speed up the resume writing process. 

The Wizard is still used at SMA, where it stores and manipulates data for 100+ biographies, 200+ projects, and 1000+ descriptions of experience. SMA has kindly let me
display the wizard online, and I have added some sample projects and employees to demonstrate it's workings.
