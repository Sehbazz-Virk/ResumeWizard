This is SMA's Resume Generator. It stores data (bios, project descriptions, etc.) in a modular format. Each record stores a chunk of text that could go in the resume as well as metadata that helps you choose which records to include. The resume template for each employee is called //Employee Name// and has two parts: an interactive table that shows you all records related to that person and the resume text that is generated from the records. 

!! List of All Resumes: [[All SMA Resumes]]

''Add Content to the Resume''
Records, which include both the bio and the projects, are included by checking the box on the left. 

''Sorting''
The bio will always be first. You can choose the order of projects using the Priority column; it will default to alphabetical. The table sorting order doesn't affect the record order. 

''Additional Projects''
Projects that aren't checked for full inclusion will show up in the Additional Projects list. 

''InDesign''
Once you have selected the records and fixed the order, you can simply copy and paste into the InDesign resume template for that person. 

''Short Resumes''
There is a "One Liner" option for Projects -- if you are making a two-pager resume, you can toggle shorter project descriptions. You will need to use the dropdown in the resume table field. 

!! Editing Content
If there are errors or if you want to update the content, you can items in the drop down below each record. Click the "caret" icon to expand. There is also a link to the master project record. 

!! Bulk Selection
If you're setting up multiple resumes and want everyone to have the same projects, you can select bios and projects for multiple people in the [[Master Bio & Experience List]] before opening the individual resume templates. The "checked" status is shared.
